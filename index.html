      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am here to program code and chew bubblegum... and I only have, like four/five pieces of gum left.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Cleveland, OH</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Playing games, solving puzzles, and going on roadtrips with my wife and our dog.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I once had a dream where I was an old timey prospector, and that was the only dream where I had a job. So, I suppose that would be my Dream Job.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In a state of constant, yet manageable panic.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love puzzles and figuring out what is wrong/how it can work better. The more frustrating the problem, the more satisfying the solution becomes.</p>
